# customwm
A highly customizable Window Manager for X.

The WindowManager allows for applying themes on the fly. Each theme lives in a zip that contains a Lua file with the configuration, along with the resource files.

The programs are:

- customwm: the X window manager
- customwm-bar: a highly configurable bar
- customwm-fm: a highly configurable file manager
- customwm-themes: a theme viewer and switcher
- customwm-theme-editor: a theme editor (?)
