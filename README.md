# customwm
A highly customizable Window Manager for X.

The WindowManager allows for applying themes on the fly. Each theme lives in a zip that contains a Lua file with the configuration, along with the resource files.

The programs are:

- **customwm**: the X window manager
- **customwm-bar**: a highly configurable bar
- **customwm-menu**: a highly configurable menu
- **customwm-fm**: a highly configurable file manager
- **customwm-theme-parser**: parse a theme file, and from that generates config files for GTK, KDE, etc...
- **customwm-themes**: a theme viewer and switcher
- **customwm-theme-editor**: a theme editor (?)
- **customwm-lib**: a library used by all, allows reading config files and has a layer on top of X
